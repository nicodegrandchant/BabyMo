# BabyMo
The code for my Baby Monitor Project will be included in this repository. 

For this project, I used Arduino IDE and an Arduino motherboard, as well as a DHT 22, Liquid Crystal Display with an I2C backpack, 
PIR Motion Sensor, RGB Module, Pulse sensor, and a buzzer.  

Its functions are the following. 

1. Provide light Feedback information to the 'parents' room
   Red = fever, temperature above 37 degrees
   Blue = motion, the baby is awake
2. Display the Fever and Pulse in the LCD screen
3. Sound a buzzer when a fever is detected

The project was created in 2023.
